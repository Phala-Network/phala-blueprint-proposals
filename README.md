## Introduction

This repository hosts the codebase for Phala Blueprint Proposals (PBPs). We encourage open and constructive discussions around the development and contributions of new blueprints to be developed.

## Logging New Proposals

To facilitate an organized approach to proposing new ideas, features or changes, we have adopted a process using the Discussions tab in GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to log new proposals:

1. Navigate to the ["Discussions" tab](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-blueprint-proposals/discussions) in the project's GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "New discussion" button.
3. In the dropdown under "Select Category", choose "Ideas".
4. Give your proposal a concise and descriptive title.
5. In the body of the discussion, provide as much detail as possible about your proposal. Describe the problem or need, your proposed solution or feature, how it could be implemented, and the benefits it would bring to the project.
6. You can also use markdown formatting to structure your proposal, add code snippets, links, images, etc.
7. When you're done, click "Start discussion".

## Response to Proposals

Once the proposal is submitted, community members can review, comment, upvote or downvote the proposal. Proposals with significant positive responses may be labeled by the maintainers for further evaluation and potential implementation. 

Please remember to engage in discussions in a respectful and constructive manner, in line with our Code of Conduct.
